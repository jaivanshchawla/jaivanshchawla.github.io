What started as me joining the placement cell as a graphic designer somehow snowballed into becoming a full-blown event coordination specialist at Manipal University Jaipur's Dell Technologies Leadership Summit 5.0, where after getting selected as Student Placement Coordinator and becoming deeply integrated with the main team, I naturally evolved into simultaneously handling Liaison Officer, Core Event Organizer, and Lead Graphic Designer roles while juggling 40+ HR professionals and 400+ attendees without completely losing my sanity (spoiler: I definitely lost it, but in the best way possible). Armed with every design software I could get my hands on - Canva, Figma, Photoshop, and Blender - I obsessively crafted 20+ visual assets including flexes, ID cards, backdrops, social media creatives, and placement reports, treating every pixel like it held the secrets to corporate success. As personal liaison to Mr. Sachin Sabyasachi from Dell Technologies HR, I became his campus guardian angel, managing everything from acoustics to coffee preferences while orchestrating full-cycle event execution with the precision of someone who definitely has color-coded spreadsheets and contingency plans for their contingency plans. Through sheer determination and probably unhealthy amounts of caffeine, I coordinated speaker onboarding, scheduling, technical execution, venue setup, and attendee management, essentially becoming a human translator between student chaos and corporate professionalism. Blessed with an incredible senior team and my brilliant graphic design partner who somehow tolerated my perfectionist tendencies, I managed to solve problems before they existed and delivered flawless execution with zero incidents - all while maintaining the enthusiasm of someone who genuinely believes that event planning is the most beautiful form of organized chaos ever invented.
