          <p>
            Picture this: You're in a hospital corridor at 3 AM. A patient needs O-negative blood urgently, but the blood bank is empty. Traditional donor lists are outdated phone directories from 2019. Facebook groups are flooded with desperate pleas. WhatsApp forwards create chaos instead of solutions.

          <p>
            The spark for Arteria ignited during our college blood donation camp in January 2025. Watching hundreds of students donate blood while manually filling paper forms like it's 1995 was the eureka moment.
